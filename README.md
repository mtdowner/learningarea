# Frontend learning pathway tracker and exercise files

This repo contains the original exercise files forked from the [MDN learning-area](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/) repo plus my solutions and other random things to track my progress.

The file structure is based off of my learning preferences, so I recommend heading over to [MDN Learning Area](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Learn) to check out these exercises for the learning pathways they put together!
